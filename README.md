# Hi, I'm VÃ­ctor Lamas ðŸ‘‹
### Backend & Android (Accessibility) Developer

I am Higher Technician in Multiplatform Applications Development trained in the creation of mobile and desktop solutions. Focus on digital accessibility to design inclusive experiences.

Over the course of these two years, I have acquired skills focused on backend development for desktop, mobile, and web applications (C#, Java, Kotlin, PHP, and NodeJS), as well as relational database management (OracleSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL) and non-relational database management (MongoDB), in addition to frameworks such as SpringBoot. I also have a basic understanding of frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular and React) and different tools such as Git, Docker, and Postman, among others.

My interest lies in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, areas in which I am currently starting a specialist course to continue my professional development.

## Professional projects:
In the professional sphere, I contributed from scratch to a newly created project on the backend of a framework designed for automated web and mobile accessibility analysis tasks. To do this, we used:
- Java, Maven, Selenium, Appium and Cucumber as the core.
- Gson and Apache POI to export the analysis results to the frontend and Excel, respectively.
- GitHub, Jenkins and SonarQube for version control, automation and code quality analysis.
